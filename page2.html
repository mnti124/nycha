              The mean and median are different in both cases. This is not
              surprising since as seen from the previous graphs, the female’s
              household image has a greater range in the x-axis compared to the
              male’s one. Furthermore when looking at the graph distributions,
              both are skewed to the right, but the tot female household graph
              has greater mean compared to the male’s; this might be attributed
              to the disparity in income, which would explain the great
              difference in numbers. Additionally, the Total Male Household
              Headed Families has a standard deviation that is fairly close to
              the mean, again showing that the graph a smaller spread across the
              data set

            <p class="var-description">
              From the graph we can see that there appears to be a linear
              association between the Total Female Headed Household Families and
              Total Male Headed Household Families. The strong correlation of
              0.9973634 between the two variables can be attributed by the need
              of families to rent a house or apartment, which causes the number
              of applicants to increase. Thus, the NYCHA will have a greater
              number of applicants. Additionally, there is a gap in the x-axis
              starting from 6000 to 8000, that is the same gap that was
              previously discussed, which might be caused by the lack of data
              for a period of time or the data might have been so small that
              they decided to ignore those values.

              In both cases the confidence interval is positive, which is not
              surprising since the standard deviations have positive values.
              Moreover the mean falls within the interval range, suggesting that
              we can be 95% certain that we obtain the true mean. Another
              observation is the difference in values of the intervals from both
              data sets, which is caused by the distribution of the data being
              more spread in the female’s household graph compared to the male’s
              one.
