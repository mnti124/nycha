            <p class="intro-desc">
              From the New York City Housing Authority, I am analyzing each
              resident’s demographic data set. The data contains 43 columns,
              consisting of many variations such as Program, Total Families,
              Total Female Headed Families, Total Male Headed Families. The
              Resident Data Book we will be analyzing involves data from March
              2013 to July 2019, which will help us understand the number of
              housing programs and families enroll in those programs in order to
              see the relationship between the number of females vs males in
              charge of the house. At this point based on the data gathered we
              can ask ourselves questions like what’s the ratio of female to
              male household head? Or Why are there more female household heads
              in charge in the programs provided by NYCHA? Since a lot of the
              calculations and data gathering is already done for us, we will
              focus on the analysis of the data set, based on a variety of
              graphs: histograms and scatter plots as well as statistical tools:
              linear regression and confidence level and more to further draw a
              more accurate conclusions for our questions.

              Description of 1st two images The first Image illustrates the
              total number of families enrolled in any of the programs provided
              by the NYCHA. As you have noticed, the graph appears to be skewed
              right with a huge gap in the middle of the graphs. The gap can be
              attributed to lack of data gathering for certain periods of time
              which may have resulted in families not applying for the programs
              or the data was so insignificant that they discharged it. While
              the other image shows the types of programs families can enroll.
              The graph shows a steady number of enrollment across all the
              programs available. However, one thing to notice is that some
              programs are more predominant than others, meaning there is more
              variety such programs supported by the NYCHA ,namely: Manhattan,
              while others are less popular: Federal.

              Description of Images Here we will look at the female and male
              families' household histograms. The female household head image
              illustrates the number of females in charge of the house based on
              their gross income. Whereas, the other graph shows the number of
              males in charge of the house. We can see that the female household
              chart has a larger range than the male, as both images are skewed
              to the right. This suggests that more women have stable and
              perhaps higher paying jobs than men, when looking at the NYCHA
              sample data set. Furthermore, similar to the Total Families
              Histogram, we can visibly see the huge gap in the middle caused by
              the small number of data gathered or lack of programs available
              for families to apply.
